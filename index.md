### Pre-requisites

Open to all graduate students, and undergraduate students with instructor approval.  Auditing will be allowed, provided auditors do the pre-work for all sessions and participate actively.

### Description

There is currently a proliferation of digital tools that support children's learning. However, the market of learning technology has been compared to "digital Wild West", where tools often emerge haphazardly and without proper grounding in research. This can lead to subpar learning outcomes or even inhibit learning. Designing learning technologies involves multiple perspectives, including learning sciences, user-centered design, software engineering, artificial intelligence and ethics. In this class, we will introduce techniques and practices of designing technology for children, provide background from the science of learning, and discuss the issues of prototyping, deployment, evaluation and ethics of educational technology. Through studio sessions, students will practice relevant techniques of responsibly developing tools for children. Students will apply these skills towards a final project where they support childrenâ€™s learning needs through a novel technological artifact. 

### Format

The class will involve two types of sessions. One day a week we will hold theoretical sessions, where we will examine the research and the theory behind various facets of designing for children. Students will be asked to complete readings and prepare discussion questions beforehand. Following jigsaw technique, students will also be asked to pick some readings and make presentations to others based on them. Invited speakers will occasionally participate in the theoretical sessions. On a different day of the week, we will hold design studios, where students will work on their projects. We will help students master relevant design and development tools, organize design critiques, meet with stakeholders (children, teachers and parents, COVID situation permitting) and play-test their projects.
