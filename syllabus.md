#### Feb. 10th - General Considerations when Designing for Children
In this session, we will look at a few recommendations from the practitioners regarding designing technologies for children. We will also look at the notion of developmental appropriateness. What children normally can do by what age?

```
Readings:
1. Resnick & Silverman (2005) Some reflections on designing construction kits for kids

```

***

#### Feb. 15th -  Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation
Motivating children is essential for their participation in learning experiences. Often designers resort to extrinsic motivation. How efficient is it? What are its limitations? How can we create intrinsic motivation for children to interact with learning technology?

```

```
Special activity: Write a 1-page reflection about what used to motivate you as a child. The reflections will be in a shared Google Slides document, so that students can see each other's ideas. Discuss in class.
```

#### Feb. 17th - Design studio

***

#### Feb. 22nd - No class (Presidents day)

#### Feb. 24th -  Learning through Play
Play is a great example of intrinsically motivated activity. But what exactly is play? And how can it be employed in service of learning?

```

Special activity: Write a 1-page reflection (in a Google Slides document) about what was a bright example of play in your life. Did you learn anything from it? Discuss in class.
```

***

#### March 1st - Learning Games
When we think about play, we often think about games. Is designing an educational game similar to "gamification" of a learning experience? If not, what does it involve?

Guest speaker - Eric Klopfer.

```
Readings: 
Klopfer et. al. (2018). Resonant games: Design principles for learning games that connect hearts, minds, and the everyday.

```

#### March 3rd - Design Studio

***

#### March 8th - Scaffolding
In the previous sections, we had a look at exploratory and child-motivated learning. However, in its unguided form, such learning is limited. Here, we examine how learning can be supported without turning it into an overly structured, drill-like activity.

```
```
Bonus question: Children seem to learn to speak on their own, without the need for teaching. Why can't they learn everything like that? Or can they?
```

#### March 10th - Design Studio

#### March 15th -  Learning Behaviors: Self-Regulation
Certain behaviors can strongly affect both how children learn and how they interact with technology. Can these behaviors be developed? Can technology help? Can it be harmful? In this session, we will look at self-regulation.

#### Mar. 31st - Design studio

#### Apr. 5th -  Learning Technologies in Contexts
Learning technologies are deployed into existing educational and social systems. Interacting with these systems is an important consideration for technology design. In this session, we will discuss what challenges might arise in this process, and are there ways to address them. 

Guest Speaker: Justin Reich (to be confirmed)

```
Readings:

#### Apr. 12th - AI for learning
AI is making rapid advances in the recent decade, and offers interesting opportunities for learning technologies. It can support personalization, one-on-one learning activities, as well as help teachers to make sense of student behaviors. However, there are challenges and ethical considerations to applications of AI in education as well. In this section, we will look at them.

#### Apr. 19th - Ethics of technology for children
Can technology harm children's learning? Can it interfere with other important aspects of childhood (e.g. socialization)? How to develop inclusive and equitable designs? What rights children have, and how technology can account for them?

What are some potential harms of your research for children? 
```

#### Apr. 26th - Evaluating designs
How do we evaluate learning technologies for children? This session will introduce both inspection and empirical evaluation methods commonly used in the field of HCI, e.g., heuristic evaluations, cognitive walkthroughs, observations/ethnograph, usability tests, and controlled experiments. We will cover strengths and weaknesses of different evaluation metrics, such as social-desirability bias for self-reported responses., and how evaluations in learning outcomes, engagement and usability can be conducted.  how children’s sSelf-reports couldand addressing the issue of socially desirable responding answers; qualitative observations; quantitative measures; design-based research paradigm.
